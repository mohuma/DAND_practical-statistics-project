### Date created
Analyze A/B Test Results project was created on 11-Oct-2021.

### Project Title
Analyze A/B Test Results

### Description
In this project, I intend to analyze the results of an A/B test run by an
e-commerce website.

My goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page,
keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

I use **Probability, A/B test (Hypothesis testing) and Logistic Regression** to
aid in my analysis.

### Files used
The following two files are used in this project:

ab_data.csv - contains results of the A/B test conducted with two user groups.

countries.csv - contains the list of countries where each user lives in.
